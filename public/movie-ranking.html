<h1>Dylan's Favourite TV Shows of All Time</h1>
<h2>Non-Animated</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>I don't care how many people complain about the last season or the ending... this is the greatest show of all time. Front to back. Start to finish. Simply amazing.</p>
<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>Starts out a little slow in the first season, but then really picks up steam. Great show. Highly Recommend.</p>
<h3>Sons of Anarchy</h3>
<p>Awesome show. Corny at times, but great television.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Animated</h2>
<h3>South Park</h3>
<p>Eric Cartman. Elite Comedy. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are goated</p>
<h3>Family Guy</h3>
<p>Much more the early seasons of Family Guy before Seth MacFarlane went woke.</p>
<h3>Big Mouth</h3>
<p>Haven't watched it in full yet but amazing show. Jay is hilarious. Good comedy, not afraid of going too far.</p>
